As per the *bonus task*

I would use POSTMAN's detailied dashboard to monitor the web API

* Functional checks
* setup a simple GET request to a specific endpoint (/ or /health) and check that it returns the HTTP status 200 OK
* Start Check status codes that are not HTTP 200 OK to identify API transactions that fail and set to ALERT
* Identify latency by checking API response times 
* Check payload data (using JSON)
* Validate payloads using JSON Schema validation
* Monitor CRUD operations like POST/PUT/DELETE
