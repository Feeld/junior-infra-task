Task: Solution Evaluation

I'd like you to **evaluate options for a monitoring system, both self-hosted and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** offerings.

Our platform is built around Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform, and your evaluation should consider the **strength, ease, and reliability of each option's integration with Kubernetes** and containerised compute in general, along with **Google Cloud Platform APIs**. Other systems we will need to integrate with, and should be included in your analysis, include **Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, and MongoDB**.

You are encouraged to find additional software and services to evaluate, but at a minimum your evaluation should include the following -

Self-hosted

**Icinga
Zabbix
Prometheus**
SaaS

**New Relic
Google Cloud Stackdriver
OpsGenie**
Please write a report detailing your evaluation of each, and finally **include a recommendation (ideally of a single option, but of no more than two options) along with the reasoning for your selection(s)**. You will not be penalised based on how many options you finally recommend, as long as it does not exceed two options.

**Please format your report using GitHub Markdown.**
