### Icinga   

Icinga is a free open-source network tool used by the likes of Adobe, Audi, T mobile and Siemens that claims to be flexible, efficient, scalable and provides automated monitoring of a business’s network resources. 

It checks these and generates notifications of outages, surges and general performance metrics visually via dashboards with the ability to be filtered for reporting and monitoring purposes. Scalable and with the ability to stretch indefinitely, Icinga can monitor large, complex environments across multiple locations.

Incing’s RESTful API allows integration with Google Cloud Platform via HashiCorp Terraform, one of the tools made available in the Advanced Nagios Plugins Collection. This allows Icinga integration with Redis, RabbitMQ, Postgres and MongoDB and Kubernetes.
