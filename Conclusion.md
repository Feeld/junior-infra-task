# Conclusion

Based on my past experience of working at a ‘megacorp’ and having everything hosted, wrote and maintained with Microsoft Azure Devops my initial choice would be to go for Google Cloud Stackdriver purely because I’m very used to things all being ‘kept’ in one place and the integration options added to the community support, tutorials, sheer amount of documentation and knowing the company won’t tank in the next 24 hours losing my data or run away with my money tends to swing me towards the ‘biggest name’. BUT I do like to support the little guys / Open Source (I am also from the North of England and therfore hate paying ;) ) and coming from a dev background I enjoy working with and supporting ‘my crew’ and through my research I found Prometheus turning my head for its integration with Kubernetes, being part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, community support (although a lack of documentation has been reported) as well as being open source and did I mention…FREE. (If money was no option, I would also throw in OpsGenie because I was excited by its multiple communication channels and assignee system but don’t think it’s worth paying over the top for, especially when it’s not a *required* and just a *nice to have*)

In conclusion (TL/DR) …

I don’t have a *winning contender* as personally I believe this matter requires further insights... like… Do we want a big name? What’s the budget like? How many users will need access to the monitoring system? How many users are on the app? What’s the usage stats like? Do we fancy ‘walking on the wild side’? 

BUT I would narrow it down to

Google Cloud Stackdriver

VS

Prometheus…

ROUND ONE!

FIGHT!
