# OpsGenie

Opsgenie is a chargeable, SaaS, real time incident management solution, powered by Atlassian. It receives alerts from our separate monitoring systems and custom applications (acting as a single source of truth) and categorises each alert based on importance and timing and alerts a designated or specific person/s.

Multiple communication channels including voice calls, email, SMS, and push messages on mobile devices. If an alert is not acknowledged or seen by its assignee, Opsgenie automatically escalates it, ensuring the incident gets the attention needed :)

Looks to integrate with Stackdriver and MongoDB but relies on a variety of paid/ freemium third parties for the rest of our stack  

### Pros
* Community support on social media
* Uses a variety of methods to contact user including Slack and voice calls
* Has a app on the PlayStore
* Scores highly (9.2 out of 10) on www.trustradius.com
* Easy to use GUI
### Cons
* Doesnâ€™t *actually* monitor applications or systems is more of an alert only system albeit a good one.
* Only integrates with half our stack
* Cost- outweighs for what it actually provides
