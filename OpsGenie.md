# OpsGenie

Opsgenie is a chargeable, SaaS, real time incident management solution, powered by Atlassian. It receives alerts from our separate monitoring systems and custom applications and categorises each alert based on importance and timing and alerts a designated or specific person/s.

Multiple communication channels including voice calls, email, SMS, and push messages on mobile devices. If an alert is not acknowledged or seen by its assignee, Opsgenie automatically escalates it, ensuring the incident gets the attention needed :)

Looks to integrate with Stackdriver and MongoDB but relies on a variety of paid/ freemium third parties for the rest of our stack
