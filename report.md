## Considerations

### Systems

- Kubernetes
- Containerisation
- GCP
- Postgres
- Redis
- RabbitMQ
- MongoDB

### Self-hosted vs SaaS

- Self-hosting carries a relatively bigger time cost but is free/open-source and allows for more granular control over the monitoring system
- SaaS carries a financial cost but significantly reduces the time required for setup


## Self-hosted

### Icinga

**Pros**

- Fast and flexible general monitoring
- 3rd party plugins for customisation

**Cons**

- There is very little official and recent documentation available on how to integrate Icinga with any of the above considerations
- Its lack of community and popularity in with regards to the stated use cases makes it a less favourable choice

### Zabbix

**Pros**

- Good, customisable data visualisation options
- Clear documentation
- Powerful alerting system
- Good for PostgreSQL and Redis
- Lots of 3rd party solutions

**Cons**

- Similarly to Icinga, there is not a lot of good information on how to use Zabbix with most of the above considerations
- Using Zabbix will likely require another set of monitoring sytems

### Prometheus

**Pros**

- Plenty of clear documentation available, good community
- Highly performant
- Integrates well with all the listed system requirements
- Has plenty of other integrations which allows for flexibility

**Cons**

- Good data visualisation does not come out of the box - requires Grafana integration
- Uses PromQL, which is another thing to learn
- No support for log management
- Pull system requires secure network configuration 

### Nagios

**Pros**

- Offers PostgreSQL support natively but not much else, in terms of the requirements above
- Flexibile
- Log managemnent
- Lots of community plugins

**Cons**

- Steep learning curve
- Does not offer many out of the box integrations for the requirements above


## SaaS

### New Relic

**Pros**

- Native support for all system requirements
- As with Prometheus, there are lots of other native integrations
- Granular metrics
- Good data visualisation options

**Cons**

- Lots of options can be overwhelming
- Can get expensive with limited free options

### Google Cloud Stackdriver (now Google Cloud Operations Suite)

**Pros**

- Native support for GCP, GKE, Redis
- Real-time log analysis
- Scalable and fully managed
- Hybrid and multi-cloud support

**Cons**

- Requires Blue Medora integration for PostgreSQL, MongoDB and RabbitMQ support
- Search can be slow, particularly old logs
- Unless configured differently, logs are unavailable after 30 days by default
- Pricing can be hard to estimate

### OpsGenie

**Pros**

- Handles alert managaement well
- Offers on-call scheduling
- Provides performance analytics

**Cons**

- Does not seem well suited to our use case â€“ it is an escalation management and notification system

### Datadog

**Pros**

- Integrates with all the system requirements
- Great flexibility and extensibility
- Active community support
- Fast and powerful 
- Log management
- Good data visualisation

**Cons**

- Heavy customisation may be overwhelming
- Steep learning curve
- Documentation isn't always great
