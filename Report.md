# Introduction

This is my report detailing my evaluation and findings for a monitoring system looking at self-hosted and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)options.

Feeld's platform is built around using Kubernetes (PaaS/ SaaS/ IaaS) on Google Cloud Platform (SaaS) and this evaluation will consider several systems/ service's that would need to integrate with these and Google Cloud Platform APIs aswell as Feeld's other existing systems Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ and MongoDB.

As part of of this I will be contrasting and comparing:

* Icinga
* Zabbix
* Prometheus
* New Relic
* Google Cloud Stackdriver
* OpsGenie

Things I will be taking into consideration will be ease of use, strengths, maintainability, weaknesses's, cost, realiability and genrally looking into the option as being fit for the buisnnes's purpose.
